# Lovley World

Palette: Island Joy 16x https://lospec.com/palette-list/island-joy-16

## TODO

- wall jump
	- similar to normal- float out at 45 degree angle until max time/released then fall straight down
- grab
- use kittenboat musicmanager for peristent bgm transition

- carry objects- throw (press grab) or drop (hold down + press grab)
	- ladders
	- torches- melt ice above you, light in darkness
		- throw and slide along ice puzzle
	- tp crystal- when dropped, teleports you to where you picked it up (but doesn't bring crystal with you)
	- parachute- slow fall to cross gaps
		- throw across gap puzzle
		- glide back to wall for multiple walljumps
	- keys & locked doors
	- reset crystal- respawns everything in room
		- except if you're holding it? (quickly pick up item to prevent its reset)
		- use key from one room on multiple doors in another
		- what if you're inside door?
	- frog with sticky tongue- grapple on ceiling
		- activated by jump key? or up/down? or on timer?
- throw object in midair pushes you back- sorta double jump
- slippery ice
- non euclidean room transitions
- item spawn rule manipulation
- moving platforms (run/jump/throw momentum)
- everything serves at least two purposes
- progression: world state change, carried item, knowledge of secrets, moons?
- rearrange Lovely World to spell Lovley World
